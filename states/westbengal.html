        <p><b>Kind of soil need to grow</b><br>
          Sugarcane can grow in any soil which can retain moisture. Ideal soil for sugarcane is deep rich loamy soil.
          <br>
          <b>Nutrients required to grow</b><br>
          Apply 37.5 kg Zinc sulphate/ha and 100 kg Ferrous sulphate/ha to zinc and iron deficient soils.
          <br>Apply phosphorus in the furrow bottom and mix slightly with soil before planting.
          <br>Nitrogen and potassium fertilizer are given in split doses, applied in bands on either side of the cane row.
          <br>
          <b>Season crop</b><br>
          Autumn is the suitable time for planting sugarcane and is done in the long stretch of October. For good yields, planting should be finished up to twentieth October. Deferral in planting may cause a decrease in yield as germination of sugarcane is diminished because of low temperature in late planting.
          <br>
          Sugarcane is a Rabi season crop .
          <br>
          <b>Demanding Scenario</b><br>
          The domestic demand of sugar is rotating around 22-23 million tonnes annually, where as the production of sugar in India during last 5 years is rotating around 24.3 to 26.3 Million ton.Global demand for sugar cane is forecast to grow over the next five years due to rising demand for alternative fuels, such as ethanol. World sugar consumption is also projected to increase over the period.

          <br>>Terial Soil.
          <br>>Gangetic alluvium Soil.
          <br>>Karail-Kewal Soil[Suggested best].
          
          <br><b>Nutrient's required to grow</b><br>
          Insufficient micronutrients are a common phenomenon in Malaysian soils derived from riverine alluvium, which affect the growth and quality of rice. A study was conducted on such soils at Kelantan, Malaysia to evaluate the effects of applying Zn (5 kg ha− 1),Cu (4 kg ha− 1) and Mo (0.5 kg ha− 1) along with the recommended N, P, K and S at 120, 30, 50, 10 kg ha− 1, respectively on rice plant growth, grain yield, quality and antioxidant activity. Any single micronutrient or in combination with macronutrients had positive effects on the growth, chlorophyll contents, grain quality, and protein content of rice. Application of micronutrients increased phenolic compound by 40% and flavonoid content by 71.54% in rice grain compared to the control, particularly, Zn and Cu had positive effects on grain protein percentage. Furthermore, the application of micronutrients increased Zn, Mo, and Cu content in grain and straw. Higher values of antioxidant activities were found in the de-husked grain compared to those of the milled rice in micronutrient applied treatments. The application of the micronutrients to the riverine alluvium soil enhanced rice yield by 18% via uptake of nutrients, attributed to increased physiological performance, leading to higher harvest index and grain quality.
          
          <br><b>Which Seasonal Crop</b><br>
          Spring is a season of beginnings, and the same goes for the new beginnings of rice. Rice planting happens in the spring, cultivation in the summer, and harvest in the fall.
          
          <br><b>Kind of crop </b><br>
          Rice is a Kharif crop that requires high temperature, heavy rainfall and high humidity for proper growth. The areas with less rainfall use irrigation for rice cultivation.
          
          <br><b>Demanding Scenario</b><br>
          The study estimates, considering GDP at 9% constant, the projected domestic demand of rice in India for the years 2011, 2016 and 2026 will be 94.4, 96.8 and 102.1 million metric tonnes respectively (Actual demand in 29011- 89 mt).

        <p><b>Kind of soil need to grow</b><br>
          Loamy and sandy loam soils, rich in organic matter with good drainage and aeration are most suitable for cultivation of potato crop. The soil with pH range of 5.2-6.4 is considered to be ideal.
          
          <br><b> Nutrients required to grow</b><br>
          Potassium is an important nutritional factor in crop management, which contributes to production of high yields of quality potato. Potato requires substantial quantity of potassium to produce an optimum yield. However, potassium needs of the crop vary with the agro-climatic region, variety, crop sequence and soil type.
          
          <br><b>Season crop</b><br>
          In Bihar, potatoes are harvested in January-March, which is followed by hot summers. Potato cannot be stored under ordinary conditions where high temperature and dry weather prevails soon after its harvest. Therefore, to sustain increased potato production, proper cold storage facilities are essential.
          
          <br><b>Kind of crop</b><br>
          Potato is a Rabi  season crop. 
          
          <br><b>Demanding Scenario</b><br>
           The average annual growth rate of potatoes will be 2.7 per cent, predicts the FAO, compared with 1.8 per cent for corn, 1.5 per cent for wheat and 1.3 per cent for rice.
          The cost of cultivation of potato in one hectare ranges from Rs 1.25 Lakh to Rs 1.5 Lakh. At the same time, a hectare yields 200-250 quintals. In such a situation, if the price of potato in the market is even Rs 15, then your potato will be sold for Rs 3.75 Lakh. That is, a profit of about Rs 2.5 lakh.
